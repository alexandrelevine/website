## Introduction

This document contains instructions to deploy a Tungsten Fabric cluster that interconnects PODs orchestrated by Kubernetes. The Tungsten Fabric cluster is composed of deployment node, one controller and two compute nodes that run as EC2 VMs.

## Requirements

Before you start using this CloudFormation template, it is necessary to subscribe to the official image of CentOS 7 x86_64 HVM.

Once you have signed into the AWS console, go to the following URL: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00O7WM7QW/" target="_blank">AWS Marketplace</a>

Press "Continue to Subscribe", then "Accept Terms".

*If you are connected as an IAM user, and you can not perform a task in AWS Marketplace, check the Appendix at the end of the document.

## Procedure

1. Just click on this button to create the stack:

<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=tungstenfabric-k8s&amp;templateURL=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tungsten-fabric-sandbox/tungsten_fabric_stack_template.yaml" target="_blank"><img alt="Launch Stack" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/buildkite/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/master/launch-stack.svg"></a>

2. Press Next.
3. Specify:
 * Your admin password for Sandbox UI
 * <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types" target="_blank">EC2 Instance type</a>
 * <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html" target="_blank">Key Pair</a> (required to access command-line utilities)
4. Press Next twice.
5. Set checkbox "Acknowledge..." at the bottom of the page.
6. Press Create.
7. Reload Stacks page and wait for Stack CREATE_COMPLETE status.
8. Select the Stack (checkbox) and check "Output" tab in the bottom pane to find Sandbox UI URL.

9. Go to Sandbox UI URL and wait for the deployment (site will be available 2-3 minutes after the creation of the stack).
10. After a successful deployment, the sandbox interface will provide information to connect to Contrail and Kubernetes services.
11. Use  Tungsten Fabric UI URLs, login and password to start.

IMPORTANT: When you've finished using the sandbox you can use the DELETE SANDBOX button to clear all of the used resources.

For double safety you can check the remaining resources in the AWS Interface.

## Accessing the cluster:

You can use the ssh key specified during the launch of the stack to access any VM with the "centos" username.

```
ssh centos@<ip>   # <ip> can be the public IP or the private IP of the controller/compute VM, both work
sudo -s
```
The sandbox interface will provide information to connect to Tungsten Fabric UI and Kubernetes dashboard.


## Appendix: IAM Users

If, instead of using a root account, you are signing with an IAM user, you need to grant additional privileges for the user.

- Log on to the AWS console.
- In the AWS services search at the top left of the console, look for IAM and select it.
- On the left navigation bar, click on the user whose privileges you need to change.
- At the right bottom, click Add inline policy.
- Go to the JSON tab, and replace the content with the following policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudformation:*",
                "aws-marketplace:*",
                "sns:*",
                "s3:*",
                "ec2:*",
                "elasticloadbalancing:*",
                "cloudwatch:*",
                "autoscaling:*",
                "iam:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

- Review policy. Add policy name. Create policy.
